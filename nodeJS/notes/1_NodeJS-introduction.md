# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Server-Side Execution**: It allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side, expanding JavaScript's reach beyond the browser.
- **Efficient Concurrency**: Utilizes a non-blocking, event-driven architecture to handle numerous concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Versatile**: More than just a runtime; it's used for creating utility tools, scripts, and complex applications.

## Key Features:

- **Asynchronous by Nature**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, allowing for non-blocking execution, which is perfect for high-traffic, data-intensive applications.
- **Scalability**: Despite being single-threaded, it is highly scalable due to its event-driven nature.
- **Data Streaming**: In Node.js, data is streamed; applications can write and send data in chunks without buffering it, enhancing performance.

## Google V8 Engine

- **Developed in C++**: Created by Google, the V8 engine is fast and efficient, translating JavaScript code into machine code.
- **Performance Boost**: Compiles JavaScript directly into native machine code that your computer can execute quickly.
- **Extended by Node.js**: Adds additional capabilities like file system access, which are not typically available in browser environments.

## REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

- **Interactive Shell**: Allows direct interaction with Node.js via a terminal, facilitating quick tests and code execution.
- **Execution of Files**: You can run entire JavaScript files by using the command `node filename.js`.
- **On-the-Fly Testing**: Useful for debugging or learning by running small snippets of code instantly.
