# Debugging Node.js Applications

## Using the debugger

Debugging code with the VsCode Debugger is good for complex problems.

> _There are a couple of ways to use the debugger._

- `launch.json` file
- running debug console

### Using `launch.json` file

> _Useful for sharing specific case with team members._

### Running debug console

> _Useful for quick debugging._

- create JavaScript debug console
- navigate to the project
- run project in the debug console

> _`console.log` is still good alternative for debugging, because of its ease and speed._
